<p>
  The goal of the Climate Ecosystem and Fisheries Initiative (CEFI) is to provide 
  information about past and future conditions for US coastal regions 🌎🌊🐟.
  Models need to be at a sufficient resolution to represent general coastal processes 
  (on the order of 8-10 km horizontal resolution, although the grid may be of 
  finer scale in the near future). In addition to historical simulation, 
  seasonal forecasts (out to 1 year), decadal forecasts (out to 10 years) 
  and long term projections (out to year 2100) will be made for several regions in the near future, 
  including:
  <strong>
  (i) the Northwest Atlantic (US east coast, Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean), 
  (ii) the Northeast Pacific (from Baja California to the Chukchi Sea in the Arctic), 
  (iii) the Arctic, 
  (iv) Pacific Islands including Hawaii, and (v) the Great Lakes.

      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        Climate change is significantly impacting the nation’s valuable marine 
        and Great Lakes ecosystems, fisheries and the many people, communities, 
        and economies that depend upon them. Warming oceans, rising seas, melting 
        sea ice and increasing acidification are affecting ecosystem structure and 
        the distribution and abundance of marine species in many regions.
      </p>
      <p>
        These changes affect many parts of NOAA’s mission, from fisheries 
        management and aquaculture to conservation of protected resources and habitats. 
        The impacts are expected to increase and there is much at risk. In the U.S., 
        for example, marine ecosystems annually contribute over $210 billion and 1.7 
        million jobs from fisheries and provide a range of other vital services 
        including recreation and protection from coastal storms and erosion.
      </p> 
      <p>
        To safeguard fisheries and other resources in the face of rapidly changing oceans, 
        resource managers and stakeholders urgently need better information on what’s 
        changing, who’s at risk and how to increase resilience. NOAA currently must 
        develop the ocean modeling and decision-support system needed to produce, 
        deliver and use information to sustain marine resources and resource-dependent 
        communities in a changing climate.
      </p>

      <h3>NOAA’s Response</h3>
      <p>
        The Climate, Ecosystems, and Fisheries Initiative (CEFI) is a cross-NOAA effort to
        build the nation-wide, operational ocean modeling and decision support system 
        (System) needed to reduce impacts, increase resilience and help marine resources
        and resource users adapt to changing ocean conditions. The end-to-end System will 
        provide decision makers with the actionable information and capacity they need to 
        prepare for and respond to changing conditions today, next year and for decades 
        to come. The CEFI System addresses four core requirements for climate-ready 
        decision-making for marine resources:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Delivery of state-of-the-art ocean and Great Lakes forecasts and projections 
          for use in developing climate-informed management advice;
        </li>
        <li>
          Operational capability to use ocean and Great Lakes forecasts and projections 
          to assess risks, evaluate management strategies and provide robust management 
          advice for changing conditions;
        </li>
        <li>
          Continuous validation and innovation through observations and research;
        </li>
        <li>
          Capability to use climate-informed advice to reduce risks and increase the 
          resilience of resources and the people that depend on them.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The CEFI is a timely, efficient, and effective way to address NOAA’s requirements for
        climate-informed marine resource management. The CEFI System will leverage existing 
        capabilities and make critical new investments in the following three System elements. 
        Each of the three System elements include components essential for the System to be 
        fully functional as illustrated in the next figure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Understanding</li>
        <li>Operational Decision Support Systems</li>
        <li>Climate Ready Decision Making</li>
      </ul>
